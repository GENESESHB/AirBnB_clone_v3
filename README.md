## Tasks

### 0. Restart from scratch!

Fork the existing codebase, update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v3, and update the README.md with information about your new contribution.

### 1. Never fail!

Ensure all current tests pass, and add new tests as much as possible.

### 2. Improve storage

Update DBStorage and FileStorage, adding two new methods: `get` and `count`. Add new tests for these methods on each storage engine.

### 3. Status of your API

Create the initial structure for the API with a status endpoint that returns a JSON response.

### 4. Some stats?

Create an endpoint that retrieves the number of each object type using the newly added `count` method from storage.

### 5. Not found

Create a 404 handler in api/v1/app.py that returns a JSON-formatted 404 status code response.

### 6. State

Create a new view for State objects that handles all default RESTful API actions.

### 7. City

Create a new view for City objects that handles all default RESTful API actions.
